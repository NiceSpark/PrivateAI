# TODO

## Improvements
- [ ] **Offline Queue**: Store notes locally when offline and sync when online.
- [ ] **Better Auth**: Use Firebase Auth or OIDC instead of a shared static secret.
- [ ] **Data Management**: Ability to list and delete remote files? (Maybe not needed for one-way flow).
- [ ] **UI Polish**: Add animations for recording and sending states.

## Bugs
- [ ] Fix sporadic audio permission issues on some Android emulators.
